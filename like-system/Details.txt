1.Requirements of a Like system.

Rules of 'Likes':

- Each user can like a specific post a single time
- A user shoudl be able to 'unlike' a post.
- Need to be able to figure out how many users like a post.
- Neet to be able to list which users like a post.
- Comments also can be liked.
- We might want to think about 'dislikes' or other kinds of reactions.

Tircs to avoid:

- Don't add a 'Likes' Column to Posts. As:
  - No way to make sure a user likes a post only once.
  - No way to make sure a user can only 'unlike' a post they have liked.
  - No way to figure out which users like a particualr post.
  - No way to remove a like if a user gets deleted :)

Trics to do:

- Add a unique constraint with UNIQUE(user_id, post_id).
- Record the type of reaction [like , love, care, funny , sad]
- Add like_type to likes table
- A like can be a 'post like' or a 'comment like'
- Referred to as a 'polymorphic association.
- Requires your app to figure out the meaning of each like.
- Can't use foreight key columns - 'liked_id' is a plain integer


-------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many alternatives.

Simples one:
Our Tables:

users
Posts
Comments
posts_likes
comments_likes

// Still want to write queries that will count up all likes?
We can use a Union or a View :)

Best :)
